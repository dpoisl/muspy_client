   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to muspy_client's documentation!
========================================

`Muspy.com <http://muspy.com>`_ is a website providing personalized RSS-Feeds
and E-Mail notifications about new albums and other releases of a users
favourite artists. Registration and use of the site is currently free (as in
beer).

The project can be found at https://github.com/alexkay/muspy/

And what is muspy_client?
-------------------------

muspy_client is -- as the name suggests -- a client for the API provided by
muspy.  The API can be used to create, manage and delete users, read and
change the subscription to artists, query release information, list releases
of an artist, ...

It provides a low-level wrapper around the various endpoints provided in the
muspy API as well as a abstracted OOP interface with a more user-centric
approach.
